too-many-hex-cores=Claim so many hexes that you start wishing they weren't so much in the way of your hypothetical megabase.
this-is-my-planet=Claim every available hex on [planet=nauvis]. Yes, it's finite! ... Or is it?
true-space-age=Research every (finite) technology. With this power, you can accomplish anything. Seriously, take a look at this reward!
half-a-gravity=Get half of a [item=gravity-coin]. Just remember, this will hardly even be pocket change when you become a quadrillionaire, so don't feel too proud of yourself!

#experienced-trader=Set up your factory to automate trading with multiple hex cores! You've probably found some good loops to make this happen efficiently.
#avid-trader=You seem to enjoy this! Automate trading with several hex cores. This can be multiple hex cores in a giant coin loop or multiple separate loops.

electrocution=Lightning safety tips are only written by people who've never been struck. The real experts aren't available for consultation.
tesla-freak=The number is bigger because there are more of the smaller numbers. It's a better strat because it's a bigger number.
you-are-the-destroyer=Be one with the zap.
electromagnetic-dungeon=The dungeons on this planet boast defenses of extreme voltage.

world-paver=What you've always dreamed of!
overwatch-dungeon=The dungeons on this planet boast defenses of extremely long-range firepower.

total-domination=You turned every alien species into technological advancements for your weapons of mass destruction, and you feel good about that? Take your "reward".
its-just-a-scratch=Get red star ranks by breaking your nice spaceship against a huge asteroid in deep space while it holds hextreme items of rank [img=rank-4]! Well, it doesn't have to be a nice spaceship...
it-wasnt-good-enough=That hextreme item was such a piece of trash. Come on, who's going to use a [item=discharge-defense-equipment,quality=hextreme]? Wait... bad example. Don't sell one of those.
the-factory-must-grow=The sentient spider will help you. Oh, you're going to use more than one? They are the same consciousness. Let's see if it works. All it wants is BIG number in the factory anyway.
