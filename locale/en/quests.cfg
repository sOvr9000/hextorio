[quest-description]
ground-zero=Claim your first two hexes. Let's start this journey!
check-this-out=Trades in hex cores have useful buttons underneath them.
biter-rammer=Ram a car into a spawner. It might be fun!
find-some-trades=Claim more [img=entity.hex-core] hex cores to find more trades! Did you get lucky?
too-many-belts=Not enough rails!
remind-me-later=You can favorite a trade for it to show up at the top of your trade overview!
look-at-my-score=Get the highest hex rank you can! Hex rank measures your overall progress through the game and Hextorio.
exploration=Claim more hexes. Take what is rightfully yours!
cracking-the-vault=Go find a strongbox and break it open! Ten times!
lockbreaker=You'll need to find more strongboxes to do this. Their levels scale infinitely, but you get soft capped eventually.
automated-clearing=While you're building factories on other planets, your turrets chip away at the loot boxes!
sprawling-base=Claim hexes far away from spawn in multiple directions. If only there was a faster way to get out there...
too-many-hex-cores=Claim so many hexes that you start wishing they weren't so much in the way of your hypothetical megabase.
this-is-my-planet=Claim every available hex on [planet=nauvis]. Yes, it's finite! ... Or is it?
true-space-age=Research every (finite) technology. With this power, you can accomplish anything. Seriously, take a look at this reward!
half-a-gravity=Get half of a [item=gravity-coin]. Just remember, this will hardly even be pocket change when you become a quadrillionaire, so don't feel too proud of yourself!
getting-somewhere=Gather enough coins to start doing some useful things other than claiming more hexes!
trades-galore=Find many trades. If only there was something you could do with the ones that are trash...
trades-in-circuitry=When you place a [item=constant-combinator] next to a [entity=hex-core], its signals are automatically configured! Now you can automate the automation!
i-really-need-that=Shut up and take my money!
i-really-dont-need-that=Perhaps one of the more convenient features, you can switch a hex core into sink mode, which sinks items for a small coin return.
first-bronze-star=This is how it all begins. Check the catalog to see an item's rank-up requirements and bonuses!
first-silver-star=Silver stars put items in other planets' trades!
first-gold-star=You can probably start trading at higher qualities with this much productivity!
first-red-star=Ranking up items on several planets draws the attention of intergalactic traders. Red stars put items in the Quantum Bazaar!
catalog-initiate=It's time to level up your items. How many items can you 100%?
catalog-professional=Ranking up items by making trades does technically make you a professional at it.
catalog-master=Shoutout to those pentapods who volunteered to die for the cause.
catalog-obsession=It kind of looks like your factory is glowing red with all of these rank-ups.
catalog-completionist=Of course this quest exists, but look at that SICK loot! This might make hextreme trading profitable.
# NOT YET USED
#novice-trader=Actively make trades with a hex core. Yes, you can technically do this by manually supplying a hex core, but it's easier to automate it and walk away! The starting hex has some good trades for this. For trading at a hex core to be counted as automated, you must make __1__ trades there in 60 seconds.
#experienced-trader=Set up your factory to automate trading with multiple hex cores! You've probably found some good loops to make this happen efficiently.
#avid-trader=You seem to enjoy this! Automate trading with several hex cores. This can be multiple hex cores in a giant coin loop or multiple separate loops.
#obsessive-trader=This is likely unnecessary for optimal production, but see if it's good. Automate trading with many hex cores.
dark-factorian-dungeon=This planet has dungeons of an ancient but familiar civilization scattered around. Can you take one down? 
lazy-looter=It's tiring work. Good thing you have drones to do the work for you! Especially if the drones are mechanical arachnids.
visit-vulcanus=Don't lose your legs here like that one guy a long, long time ago.
stepping-on-ants=It's just a small one, it can't be that hard!
stepping-on-beetles=Show them who owns this planet!
cant-step-on-that=They're not the bad guys in this story.
this-is-fine=It was all part of the plan, actually.
copper-flavored-lava=It's not any hotter than the tea at that one cuisine.
vulcanus-101=Every planet's factory starts with mining the raw resources!
metallurgic-dungeon=The dungeons on this planet boast defenses of extreme heat.
visit-fulgora=It has oil!
my-hair-feels-funny=It kind of feels good. Is this why others come here and never leave?
electrocution=Lightning safety tips are only written by people who've never been struck. The real experts aren't available for consultation.
tesla-freak=The number is bigger because there are more of the smaller numbers. It's a better strat because it's a bigger number.
you-are-the-destroyer=Be one with the zap.
lazy-bastard=Automating crafting was the easy part.
electromagnetic-dungeon=The dungeons on this planet boast defenses of extreme voltage.
visit-gleba=What a beautiful planet!
yummy-co=Your yumako fruit trading company is coming along well here!
five-legs-werent-enough=For only three more legs, they could've been spiders, and spiders are really cool.
farm-fresh-eggs=Fresh eggs here!
farm-fresh-produce=Fresh produce here!
industrial-garden=Take some time to smell the poison. Or the flowers if you prefer.
biochemical-dungeon=The dungeons on this planet boast defenses of extremely toxic matter.
visit-aquilo=An icy marble glimmering in space... dawg, yo mama so fat she's the reason this planet's icebergs are so far apart.
i-am-the-demolisher=Be one with the 150kg rain drops... I mean railgun shells.
collateral-damage=Hopefully you don't have to find out the hard way that your own railguns can kill you.
pond-filler=You only brought enough to fill this pond. This little pond.
world-paver=What you've always dreamed of!
overwatch-dungeon=The dungeons on this planet boast defenses of extremely long-range firepower.
dungeon-mastery=The dungeons were never in your way. In fact, you thought they were only there to give more space on [planet=fulgora] and [planet=aquilo] for factories.
total-domination=You turned every alien species into technological advancements for your weapons of mass destruction, and you feel good about that? Take your "reward".
its-just-a-scratch=Get red star ranks by breaking your nice spaceship against a huge asteroid in deep space while it holds hextreme items of rank [img=rank-4]! Well, it doesn't have to be a nice spaceship...
it-wasnt-good-enough=That hextreme item was such a piece of trash. Come on, who's going to use a [item=discharge-defense-equipment,quality=hextreme]? Wait... bad example. Don't sell one of those.
the-factory-must-grow=The sentient spider will help you. Oh, you're going to use more than one? They are the same consciousness. Let's see if it works. All it wants is BIG number in the factory anyway.
