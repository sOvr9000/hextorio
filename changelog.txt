    - [item=firearm-magazine] and [item=piercing-rounds-magazine] are now also craftable in [entity=foundry].

  Optimizations:
    - Greatly optimized hex generation and overall UPS.

  Balancing:
    - Supercharging is now unlocked on [planet=vulcanus].

      Negative productivity will decrease the trade's output rate, e.g. -100% prod means 1/2 of normal output rate, -200% prod means 1/3 of normal output rate, etc.
      This prevents the exploit of quickly generating unlimited [item=hexaprism-coin] on Nauvis before you have to visit other planets.

    - The spawn hex on [planet=gleba] now generates with a starting amount of [entity=yumako-tree] and [entity=jellystem].

    - [planet=vulcanus], [planet=fulgora], and [planet=gleba] now have finite planet size.
    - Sentient spider and demolisher techs now also require [item=military-science-pack].

    - Removed tree seeds from trade generation on [planet=nauvis].
    - Removed discharge defense equipment from trade generation on all planets except [planet=fulgora]. (IT IS BUFFED)
  Balancing:
    - Buffed [item=discharge-defense-equipment]. It now functions as a personal tesla turret like Wube Software probably would have originally intended, given that it has always been an electric beam weapon.
    - Buffed [item=destroyer-capsule]. It now functions as a flying tesla turret like Wube Software probably would have originally intended, given that it has always used an electric beam weapon.

        Normal in, normal out. Rare in, rare out, etc.
        Only one trade is needed for all qualities. Works up to the hex core's quality.
        Coins do not have quality, so they multiply for each quality tier.
        NOTE: Quality purchases require more coins than the coins obtained from selling at the same quality.
        (This is a default mod setting to prevent an infinite coin exploit.)
    - Dropdown added to hex cores for viewing trades with different qualities on the items, particularly used to see how coin inputs and outputs are affected by quality.
    - Production statistics now include the statistics of currently active trading on each surface.
    - Added selection tool for claiming hexes.

    - Clicking on any ping in chat that's on a hex core brings up that hex core's GUI.
    - When viewing a hex core, clicking on an item in a trade brings up that item in the Factoriopedia.
  Features:
    - When viewing the trade overview, clicking on an item in a trade sets the filter to that item on the opposite side of the trade.
      For example, you click on an input item for a trade, it sets the trade overview filter so that you can see trades that let you obtain that item.
      Helps to quickly find trade loops.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that input loaders on the sides of hex cores weren't working.
    - Fixed that new trades that should have productivity didn't.
