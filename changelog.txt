Version: 0.3.2
Date: 14/5/25
  Major Features:
    - Added [planet=fulgora].
    - Added tier 6 quality: hextreme.
  Balancing:
    - Worms, nests, and hex cores now increase in quality by distance on [planet=nauvis].
  Modding:
    - Hextreme quality can be disabled if you want another mod to replace it.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed blinking trades in hex cores.
    - [item=crude-oil-barrel] no longer shows up in trades on [planet=vulcanus].
  Features:
    - Trades now work on a per-quality basis.
        Normal in, normal out. Rare in, rare out, etc.
        Only one trade is needed for all qualities. Works up to the hex core's quality.
        Coins do not have quality, so they multiply for each quality tier.
        NOTE: Quality purchases require more coins than the coins obtained from selling at the same quality.
        (This is a default mod setting to prevent an infinite coin exploit.)
    - Production statistics now include the statistics of currently active trading on each surface.
  Minor Features:
    - Planets now show in item tooltips to indicate that the item value is strongly tied to that planet.
    - Press T to teleport to the hex core under your mouse pointer.

      For example, you click on an input item for a trade, it sets the trade overview filter so that you can see trades that let you obtain that item.
      Helps to quickly find trade loops.
