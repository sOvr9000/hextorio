---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 31/5/25
  Features:
    - Added more quests and rewards.
  Changes:
    - Sentient Spider is now equipped with 1x [item=teslagun] instead of 4x [item=rocket-launcher].
    - Sentient Spider now has a larger equipment grid.
    - Trades can now only be made with researched qualities.
    - Changed silver rank bonus to guarantee at least one interplanetary trade for every item on every planet.
  Gui:
    - Changed the sink and generator mode icons.
    - Changed the red star rank bonus description.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the factoriopedia simulation for hexaprisms and hexic underground belts.
    - Added localization for the crystalline fuel tech.
    - Fixed fish spawning.
    - Removed [item=cliff-explosives] from all planets except [planet=vulcanus].
    - Fixed that concrete was removing egg rafts and stromatolites on [planet=gleba].
    - Fixed that the selling part of ranking up an item to gold stars didn't count.
    - Fixed that sink mode trade conversion was skipping some items randomly.
  Balancing:
    - Supercharging is now unlocked on [planet=vulcanus].
    - Quality trades now have a trade productivity decrement based on the tier of quality, e.g. an uncommon trade loses 35% productivity.
      Negative productivity will decrease the trade's output rate, e.g. -100% prod means 1/2 of normal output rate, -200% prod means 1/3 of normal output rate, etc.
      This prevents the exploit of quickly generating unlimited [item=hexaprism-coin] on Nauvis before you have to visit other planets.
    - Trade productivity bars are now tracked separately for each quality, preventing easy exploits for high quality items.
    - The spawn hex on [planet=gleba] now generates with a starting amount of [entity=yumako-tree] and [entity=jellystem].

  Minor Features:
    - Item/fluid names now show in the custom tooltips seen in trades and initial resources UI.
    - A tooltip now shows for coin amounts if they are abbreviated with units like "k" or "M".
  Changes:
    - [planet=vulcanus], [planet=fulgora], and [planet=gleba] now have three trades per hex instead of two.
    - [planet=vulcanus], [planet=fulgora], and [planet=gleba] now have finite planet size.
    - Sentient spider and demolisher techs now also require [item=military-science-pack].
  Bugfixes:
    - Took [item=destroyer-capsule] out from trade generation on all planets except [planet=fulgora]. (IT IS BUFFED)

    - Fixed interplanetary value calculation.

    - Fixed that large coin values in trades were showing as the wrong tier of coin.

Date: 25/5/25

    - Removed tree seeds from trade generation on [planet=nauvis].
    - Removed discharge defense equipment from trade generation on all planets except [planet=fulgora]. (IT IS BUFFED)
  Balancing:
    - Buffed [item=discharge-defense-equipment]. It now functions as a personal tesla turret like Wube Software probably would have originally intended, given that it has always been an electric beam weapon.
    - Buffed [item=destroyer-capsule]. It now functions as a flying tesla turret like Wube Software probably would have originally intended, given that it has always used an electric beam weapon.
    - Buffed [item=teslagun]. It is now actually an upgrade from [item=submachine-gun].

        Normal in, normal out. Rare in, rare out, etc.
        Only one trade is needed for all qualities. Works up to the hex core's quality.
        Coins do not have quality, so they multiply for each quality tier.
        NOTE: Quality purchases require more coins than the coins obtained from selling at the same quality.
        (This is a default mod setting to prevent an infinite coin exploit.)
    - Dropdown added to hex cores for viewing trades with different qualities on the items, particularly used to see how coin inputs and outputs are affected by quality.
    - Production statistics now include the statistics of currently active trading on each surface.
    - Added selection tool for claiming hexes.
  Minor Features:

    - Copying and pasting hex core settings now copies over loader filters along with the inventory filters.
    - Clicking on the arrow in a trade pings it in chat.
    - Clicking on any ping in chat that's on a hex core brings up that hex core's GUI.
    - When viewing a hex core, clicking on an item in a trade brings up that item in the Factoriopedia.
  Features:
    - When viewing the trade overview, clicking on an item in a trade sets the filter to that item on the opposite side of the trade.
      For example, you click on an input item for a trade, it sets the trade overview filter so that you can see trades that let you obtain that item.
      Helps to quickly find trade loops.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that input loaders on the sides of hex cores weren't working.
    - Fixed that new trades that should have productivity didn't.
