---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.0
Date: 20/2/26
  Major Features:
    - Item values are now dynamically calculated (including modded items) on game start or when the command /solve-item-values is run.
        All modded items will follow the same value scaling rules as vanilla items based on:
        > number of unique items and fluids in recipes
        > recipe crafting time
        > spoil rates
        > food (like bioflux) for captive biter spawners (this gives biter eggs value, and similar modded items if present)
        > rocket part costs (modded rocket silos and modified rocket part requirements are accounted for, and this partly determines cross-planet transport costs)
        > stack sizes (when being sent to other planets for necessary production, e.g. holmium plates for lithium or bioflux for biter eggs)
        > distances between planets (when production requires interplanetary imports)
        > overall multiplier to each recipe's products based on the planet (like x1.2 on top of all other scaling factors combined)
  Features:
    - Added buttons to the trade overview (to the left of the "close" button) for cycling through past filter combinations, alternatively activated by hotkey.
    - Added settings for configuring how item values propagate throughout recipes, namely raw item values and planet-specific scaling rates.
    - The /export-item-values command now also includes item value sources and recipe data for use with the Hextorio Item Value Explorer (HIVE) web tool.
    - Added the /solve-item-values command.
    - Added setting for configuring sink/generator trade efficiency.
  Minor Features:
    - Added the has_untradable_items field to trades in the trades JSON export, which indicates whether the trade contains any items that are initially untradable on its planet (only set to true for trades created by the silver item rank bonus).
    - Added item buffs for: burner mining drill, hazard concrete, spoilage, nutrients.
    - Trades now reevaluate (changing item counts but not item types) when the "Base Trade Efficiency" setting is changed.
  Changes:
    - The trade overview sorting method "Distance from spawn" now compares the pathing distances from spawn for each trade, not the straight-line distances that would go over unclaimable hexes.
    - The is_interplanetary field in trades in the trades JSON export now corresponds to whether the trade contains any items that can only be obtained after importing at least one item from another planet.
    - Overhauled the system that determines which items are initially tradable on each planet.
        It used to be based on whether items were considered "interplanetary", but it is now based on which recipes are usable on each planet and when/where they're unlocked.
    - The command /set-item-value now marks an item as a raw resource on a planet rather than overriding its computed value directly.
        Useful for quickly integrating custom modded raw resources to compute their entire item value graph.
    - The command /remove-item-value now also clears the raw value entry set by /set-item-value, preventing it from reappearing after a solver run.
    - The number of items required to be ranked up for the quest "Catalog Completionist" is now dynamic, including rankable modded items.
    - Revised the tooltips for the item buffs "All Buffs Cost Reduced", "Unresearched Penalty Reduced", and "Strongbox Loot".
    - Reduced the total number of strongbox levels from 36 to 28.
    - Strongboxes at the maximum level no longer respawn when destroyed.
    - Reduced hex claim costs on all planets except Nauvis to reflect the item value rebalancing.
  Balancing:
    - Changed all exponential item buff scaling to linear.
    - Changed default sink/generator trade efficiency from 10% to 25%.
    - Reduced default setting "Total Hexes" for Nauvis from 7000 to 5000.
    - Reduced default setting "Total Hexes" for Gleba from 4000 to 1800.
    - Reduced default setting "Total Hexes" for Aquilo from 1800 to 600.
    - Strongbox coins are now based on the maximum achieved net coin production.
        When reaching higher amounts of net coin production, the extra coins that past strongboxes would've given are retroactively given to all players.
    - Rebalanced item values to be less about a planet's stage in the game progression but instead more about actual difficulty of obtainment.
        For example, coal/iron/copper on Vulcanus is now less valuable than on Nauvis, and oil-based products on Fulgora now generally have low values.
    - Item values are now affected by each planet's core challenges:
        Nauvis' items are scaled "normally".
        Vulcanus' items are scaled weakly due to having easy power scaling, plentiful resources, and open building spaces.
        Fulgora's items are scaled strongly due to limited building space and overall complexity of (sustainable) power production.
        Gleba's items are scaled strongly due to item spoilability (requiring special layouts to minimize loss of freshness) and overall complexity of (sustainable) power production.
        Aquilo's items are scaled the strongest due to dependency on interplanetary items (and its distance from other planets) as well as recipe complexity / the number of items and fluids involved in each recipe (since entity heating restricts layouts and sometimes scalability).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed coin trade "free proc" bug.
    - Fixed game crashing when attempting to clear the trade quality selector button's selection.
    - Fixed that changing the claim cost settings wouldn't apply the changes to currently existing hexes that don't yet have hex cores.
    - Fixed that the command alias "in-hand" didn't work for ghost objects held in cursor.
  Gui:
    - Revised the help info for the "Net Coin Production" hex rank factor.

        For use with world generation modes that generate mazes.
    - Added "Total Hexes" settings for all planets, which control approximately how many hexes (and proprtionally trades) are generated for the respective planet.
  Minor Features:
    - Added hotkey for quickly picking up all dropped items on the ground.  Useful when coin spillage occurs by accident.
  Changes:
    - Spiral world generation mode can now generate with either orientation of a spiral (clockwise or counterclockwise).
    - Properly adapted hexaprism spawning conditions to all world generation modes (even ones injected by other mods).
    - Revised the English description of the "Hex Span" quest condition type to more clearly describe that it measures "straight line" distance as opposed to "path through claims" distance.
    - Removed "Planet Size" settings for all planets.
    - Changed default island shapes on Vulcanus, Fulgora, Gleba, and Aquilo, each adjustable in mod settings.
    - Hex claim costs are now based on "path through claims" distance from spawn rather than "straight line" distance.
    - Trade volumes (total item values in trades) are now based on "path through claims" distance instead of "straight line" distance.
    - Passing signals R=0, G=0, and B=0 to a hex core no longer shuts off the light and instead makes it continue to use the default hexlight colors as defined in the settings.
  Balancing:
    - A hex containing sulfuric acid geysers (on Vulcanus) or crude oil wells (on Nauvis) is now guaranteed to exist near the spawn hex.
    - All world generation modes now produce islands with a configurable number of total hexes (in settings) so that Maze mode doesn't have too few hexes/trades and Solid mode doesn't have too many (for example).
    - The highest valued items on each planet now show up at 30% of the distance from spawn to the edge of the island, based on "path through claims" distance.
    - Increased the default "Vault Chance" setting value from 0.02 to 0.05 to compensate for the altered default island shape of Fulgora.

    - Fixed that hextreme quality was not showing up in trade quality selection.
    - Fixed that the /summon command would only spawn units on Nauvis.
    - Fixed incompatibilities with some quality mods.

    - Slightly optimized trade processing.
    - Optimized some hexagonal math calculations.
    - Greatly optimized all chunk generation (setting tile types more efficiently).
        There's now significantly less time wasted on GC (memory stuff).

  Features:
    - Added the hex rank system, unlocked via the new early-game quest.
    - Added new quest: "Look at My Score".
  Minor Features:
    - Added command /disable-quest, which lets you skip a quest in the progression path.  For example, "/disable-quest biter-rammer" to avoid having to ram biters with vehicles to progress.
        Note that this also permanently makes its specific rewards unobtainable.  To skip and get the rewards, use "/complete-quest <quest>".
    - Added command /reload-item-buff-effects, for resetting all item buff effects.  Does not reset levels, only what effects are being applied.
        There should never be a need for this function going forward, but it now exists if anything goes wrong (again).
    - A different sound from "console message" can now be played when a quest gets completed, configurable in player mod settings.
  Changes:
    - Disabled the original method of ranking up items to red stars (destroy your ship outside of the solar system while carrying hextreme items).
    - Removed the mod setting for default trade quality bounds.
    - Trades now only use a single quality at a time.

    - The "Coins in Inventory" quest conditions now keep track of the most coins held at once, never going down.
    - Removed the deprecated /simple-trade-loops command.
  Balancing:
    - Added mod setting that toggles the allowance of two-headed trains in trading.
    - Changed the default value for the base trade efficiency setting from 1.0 to 0.8, where at least 25% trade productivity is required to create infinite coin loops.
    - If the "Electrocution" quest is revealed but not yet completed, then the next lightning strike that hits your character will now call for Fulgora's magnificent storms to finish the job.
    - Increased the default setting for trades per hex on Fulgora from 3 to 4 to accommodate for the fewer total hexes available to claim.

        This does not mean perfect compatibility, but instead the crash on save load is fixed.
  Scripting:
    - Added remote interfaces.
  Optimizations:
    - Optimized overall trading performance. The improvement is proportional to the number of players online at once.
    - Slightly optimized coin calculations.
    - Optimized random trade generation.

    - Notifications about extra trades (bronze star effect), interplanetary trades (silver star effect), and trade recovery (gold star effect) now also show the trade in the text.
  Balancing:
    - Trades that give items which are not yet produceable with a researched recipe now have a penalty to trade productivity. Can be tweaked or disabled in the mod settings.

    - Lines only show between trades once the "Trade Configuration" feature is unlocked.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that spidertrons and other vehicles would disappear when a hex core spawns underneath them.
    - Fixed that connecting cliff sprites were not updated after a hex core spawns in their way, destroying them.
    - Fixed that the mod setting for the bronze rank effect did not actually change the effect.
    - Fixed that trade productivity progress bars could be off by very tiny amounts when they shouldn't be (floating point rounding errors).
  Optimizations:
    - Throttled processing for most of the frame-dropping events: item rank ups (trade productivity updates) and trade overview calculations.
    - When multiple players are using the trade overview simulataneously, the calculations are load balanced (full speed for one player, half speed for two players, etc.).
    - Optimized sorting trades in the trade overview by total item value.
    - Optimized trade productivity updates.
    - Part of the trades JSON export is batch-processed, spanning more than one tick.

Date: 16/12/25
  Changes:
    - Increased the Passive Coins buff interval of coin accumulation from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.

    - Fixed that the command /regenerate-trades could put interplanetary trades on the wrong planets.
    - Fixed that the claim tool would sometimes claim dungeon hexes.
    - Fixed that the claim tool would sometimes ignore claiming the selected hexes.
    - Fixed that the claim tool would sometimes let you claim a hex you cannot afford, taking your coins anyway.
    - Fixed rare crash upon dungeon generation.
    - Fixed that dungeon chests could be spawned inside of other entities.
    - Fixed rare crash around item value retrieval.
    - Fixed that the auto-claiming after looting a dungeon would spend free hex claims.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.9
Date: 12/12/25
  Bugfixes:
    - Hotfix for servers running the game with no players online.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.8
Date: 12/12/25
  Bugfixes:
    - Hotfix for servers running the game with no players online.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.7
Date: 12/12/25
  Changes:
    - Improved train item insertion logic.
    - Extended the tooltip for the locomotive trading button in the hex core GUI to make it clearer that the number of cargo wagons allowed per train trade is limited but upgradeable.
  Gui:
    - Reworked Quantum Bazaar interface.
  Balancing:
    - Increased the requirements for most "total item rank" quests.
    - Multiplied the loot value of dungeon chests on all planets by 10x, effectively upgrading all rolled loot items by one quality level.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed rare crash with output buffer unloading.
    - Fixed that train trading input inventory wasn't limited like output inventory.
    - Fixed train item insertion direction for double-ended trains making trades.
    - Fixed the gun turrets spawning incorrectly for the deathworld mod setting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.6
Date: 11/12/25
  Minor Features:
    - Added item buffs for locomotives and cargo wagons.
    - Extended the functionality of the claim tool: Hold shift while selecting to also try to claim hexes that don't have hex cores yet (but will when intermediate hexes get claimed), and use RMB to remove hexes from the claim queue.
  Changes:
    - Unvisited surfaces no longer have an entry in the JSON trades export.
    - The clear filters button in the trade overview now leaves your planet filters alone unless all planets are toggled off.
    - Hex cores are now able to make "sequences" of trades in one processing tick from the first trade to the last.
        For example, if there's a coin-to-coal trade and a coal-to-stone trade below it, then the coal obtained from the coin-to-coal trade will immediately be available to the coal-to-stone trade.
  Balancing:
    - Limited the number of wagons that a train can use in trading.
    - Buffed crystalline fuel's effect on train speed and acceleration.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that trading was sometimes blocked by output buffers, affecting both trains and hex cores.
    - Fixed that multiple trades could occur at the same time consuming the same items at the same time, only removing items for the cost of one of the trades.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.5
Date: 11/12/25
  Major Features:
    - Integrated locomotives into the trading nexus:
        Cargo wagons of trains at a train stop now serve as substitute inventories for the hex core in the same hex as the train stop.
        Upon arrival at a stop, if the associated hex core is set to allow trading with trains, the train's inventories will be used for trading.
  Changes:
    - Made the output buffer loading smarter, preventing from trading too many stacks of items at once.
        (e.g. buying cars with hexaprism coins doesn't put billions of cars into the output buffer that'll take an eternity to unload.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.4
Date: 10/12/25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed rare crash around the mod's GUIs. (again)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 9/12/25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed rare crash around the mod's GUIs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2
Date: 9/12/25
  Major Features:
    - Added item buffs for lightning rods and lightning collectors.  This buff unlocks and enhances passive coin accumulation in player inventories based on current net coin generation rate through trading.
    - Added quest reward on Vulcanus which allows teleporting to hex cores on other planets as long as there are no items in your inventory (except your equipped armor and weapons).
  Features:
    - Added ability to favorite trades by clicking the trade arrow.  Favorited trades always show at the top of the trade overview list if they pass the filter as per usual.
  Minor Features:
    - Teleportation to hex cores now works while inside a spidertron or other vehicle, bringing the vehicle with you.
    - Added hotkeys for opening/closing the questbook, catalog, and trade overview.
    - Added button in the catalog for opening the trade overview with the selected item set in the filter, the side depending on what remains to be done for ranking up the item.
    - Added button in trade overview for swapping sides of the filter.
    - Added quest for teaching how to favorite a trade and what favoriting a trade does.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that dungeon laser and tesla turrets were frozen on Aquilo.
    - Fixed rare crash with GUI management.
  Changes:
    - Swapped the meanings of the bronze star halves in item ranks.
  Balancing:
    - The Quantum Bazaar no longer lets you buy items of qualities that you haven't yet unlocked.  Selling items of locked qualities is still allowed.
    - Fixed that "upgrade all item buffs" could get stuck in an infinite loop and crash the game.
  Gui:
    - Added notes to the rewards unlocking the sink and generator modes to indicate the trade-offs of using them, allowing for a more concise description of each mode.
    - Changed the checkmarks and X's for the buy/sell rank-up instructions to checkboxes which check off and gray out when completed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 6/12/25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that quest progress was getting reset upon updating to some versions of the mod.
        This version recalculates some important quest progress like catalog completion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 6/12/25
  Major Features:
    - Added the electromagnetic penetrator handheld weapon.
  Minor Features:
    - Added the "ping in chat" button for trades in the trade overview.
    - Added mod settings for tweaking trade productivity requirements for ranking up items.
    - Added mod settings for scaling dungeon chest loot value.
  Changes:
    - The Sentient Spider is now equipped with six electromagnetic penetrators instead of one (buffed) teslagun.
    - Changed Sentient Spider recipe to reflect its new abilities.
    - Recalculated item values on Aquilo and Fulgora.
    - Clicking an item in a trade while a hex core is open now opens the trade overview instead of the catalog.
    - Dungeon hexes no longer contribute to the total trades found, preventing from quickly completing the "Find Some Trades" quest.
    - Removed the map colors of hexlights and hexports.
    - The item selector for trade contents in the trade overview now only shows items that can be found in trades.
    - Made the tooltips for the sink and generator buttons more concise.
    - Due to game engine performance issues on saves with thousands of trades showing in the trade overview, the maximum is now 250 total trades to be shown.
        This does not affect filtering or which trades are searched; it only keeps you from lagging the game with more UI elements than you could ever need.
    - Increased Sentient Spider equipment grid size from 12x10 to 12x12.
  Gui:
    - Horizontally centered the "Bonuses" text in the catalog.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when viewing red star ranked items if your character is missing (in editor mode, god mode, etc.).
    - Fixed crash when trying to sell the item stack in your hand at the Quantum Bazaar when nothing is held.
    - Fixed hexlights and hexports remaining after hex core deletion.
    - Fixed hexlights causing collision clipping at the corners of hex cores.
    - Fixed missing localization for inserter capacity in the item buffs.
    - Fixed resource patches floating over marsh tiles on Gleba.
    - Fixed scaling bugs in UI across different display scales.
    - Fixed broken rich text in item tooltips of quest rewards when questbook is viewed from space.
    - Added the missing value for iron ore on Fulgora.
        This was fixed by including the concrete recycling recipe as well as other common recycling recipes in the item value solver.
        As a result, the extra iron obtained from concrete and electronic circuits has shifted the relative item values drastically.
    - Fixed that the total produced/consume items statistics in hex cores was incrementing more than it should (this was related to the frame stutters).
    - Fixed that flying text was emitting more often than it should (same issue as above).
  Optimizations:
    - Decreased batch sizes and processing intervals, reducing the risk of frame stutters on large saves.
    - Decreased number of UI layout updates in the trade overview for the same number of trades listed. O(n^2) -> less O(n^2), but substantial improvement.
    - Optimized trade overview "exact" filtering. Small improvement.
    - Optimized trade overview planet filtering. ~2x speedup.
    - Optimized trade processing output buffering. Fixes root cause of largest stutters.
    - Optimized trade processing coin calculations. Small improvement.
    - Optimized hex core pool management (implemented load balancing). Substantial improvement on some saves.

Date: 27/11/25
  Features:
    - Hex cores now emit flying text when they make a trade.  Can be disabled in the mod's player settings.
    - Hex cores now emit light, the color of which reacts to circuit signals.
        Default colors adjustable in mod settings!
    - Added "Enable Hexports" selection tool, allowing for large-scale enabling or disabling of hexports.
    - Added filters in trade overview for filtering out non-interplanetary trades, trades in dungeon hexes, and trades that are either in "sink" or "generator" hex cores.
  Minor Features:
    - Added "total belting distance", "sink / generator", and "dungeon" info to the output of /simple-trade-loops, as they are fast calculations.
  Balancing:
    - Made the stack inserter item buff require one less upgrade to have another effect on top of the initial unlock.
    - Slightly increased the range of dungeon gun turrets.
    - Slightly decreased the range of dungeon flamethrower and laser turrets.
    - Decreased the damage of dungeon turrets.

    - Changed the quest reward of "Catalog Initiate" which gives +10% trade productivity to give +5% instead.
    - Changed the default mod settings for planet-based trade productivity bonuses to start from 0% on Nauvis instead of -20%, with the intention to reduce confusion for new players of the mod.
        The default settings are now:
          Nauvis = 0%
          Vulcanus = 5%
          Fulgora = 10%
          Gleba = 15%
          Aquilo = 20%
    - Revised item rank up requirements:
        Bronze - unchanged (buy and sell item once)
        Silver - buy this item using a trade with at least +30% productivity
        Gold - unchanged (electrocute an enemy unit near a trade involving this item with +70% productivity)
        Red - sell this item using a trade with at least +120% productivity
  Changes:
    - Added extra conditions and info to the first few quests to improve NPE (new player experience).
    - Made the /simple-trade-loops command public.
    - Added cooldowns to some public commands to reduce the risk of griefing by overloading the server.
    - Reformatted output from /simple-trade-loops.
    - Changed the default hex pool size from 1000 to 250, allowing for larger saves before noticing potential UPS drops from all the trading.
    - Changed the rocket capacities of all coins to their respective stack sizes.
    - Dungeon hex cores now spawn immediately when the dungeon generates, giving them a glow.
    - The quest "Biter Rammer" now also gives 50 magmatic round magazines as a reward.
    - Moved some of the starting trades on Nauvis to adjacent hexes.
    - Hexports are no longer enabled globally upon unlocking them and instead require toggling each one, most easily done via the hexport tool.
        Hexports still automatically toggle on for newly claimed hexes.
    - Increased Fulgora concrete filling ratio between hexes to compensate for the lost area in the claimed hexes due to a bugfix.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that dungeons invisibly occupied some hexes just outside of themselves, preventing you from claiming them.
    - Fixed that hex cores did not correctly show whether the hexports were currently enabled.
    - Fixed crash on running the command /hextorio-debug when in remote view.
    - Fixed various crashes with incorrect command use.
    - Fixed that updating the mod settings for planet-based trade productivity bonuses would not take effect without a restart.
    - Fixed floating point rounding errors around 0 for trade productivity.
    - Fixed that item-giving quests would not drop a remainder of a stack if the inventory is nearly full instead of only dropping entire stacks that wouldn't fit.
    - Fixed that hexports were off-center from the hex core.
    - Fixed that hexports were showing vulnerability to lightning strikes on Fulgora.
    - Fixed crash caused by other mods removing or restructuring title screen music.
    - Fixed that concrete was covering too much area over hexes, where it was being placed over water around the perimeter of the land.

  Gui:
    - Trade arrows display nonzero productivity without mousing over them.
    - Softened the white and cyan trade arrow sprites.
    - Removed the boxes around each trade, de-cluttering the hex core GUI and trade overview.
    - Moved the trade arrow's tooltip to a more obvious location that's below the trade, having the sprite of a productivity module.
    - Added button for pinging trades.
    - Improved trade overview layout.
    - Some trade overview filters that become irrelevant under certain conditions are now grayed out, e.g. "max output trades" slider grays out when "exact outputs match" is enabled.
    - Made the hex core buttons wrap around instead of leaving the background GUI.
  Optimizations:
    - Optimized dungeon turret reloading.
    - Optimized ahead-of-time chunk generation around players.

    - Added Fulgora quest to unlock free roboports ("Hexports") built into hex cores that require no power.
  Features:

        Don't forget about /add-trade and /remove-trade for maximum control of a new playthrough!
    - Added command parameter aliases: in-hand, here
        in-hand: This parameter takes the value of whatever item you're holding.
        here: This parameter takes the value of whatever planet your character is currently on.
        Useful for when setting values for modded items but you don't know what the hyphenated names are:
        /set-item-value in-hand 100 here
  Minor Features:
    - Added two mod settings, "Default Trade Quality" and "Increment Trade Quality", to control how trade quality bounds are initialized or managed.
    - Added an early quest to inform new players of the mod that trade arrow tooltips give important information.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed all possible crashes that could be caused by using the wrong value types in commands.
    - Fixed that stack inserters and biolabs had no item value, causing them to never show up in trades or the catalog.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
Date: 15/11/25
  Features:
    - Added several quests. There are now 50 in total.
  Balancing:
    - Added tiered quests for item ranks to fill the progression gap.
    - Replaced the "Catalog Professional" quest with the new, equivalent "First Red Star" quest.
    - Moved the "Catalog Professional" quest to an earlier stage of the game, having easier requirements.

    - Fixed that an overflowing trade could block other trades from occurring in some situations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 1/10/25
  Gui:
    - Added image for the "Catalog Professional" quest.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that updating the mod would duplicate rewards for quests.
    - Fixed that landfill was blocking the spawning of concrete between hexes.
    - Fixed crash caused by looting a 1.0.x dungeon in 1.1.0 or later.
    - Fixed crash caused by visiting a previously unvisited planet after migrating from a 1.0.x save.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
Date: 29/9/25
  Features:
    - Added quest "Catalog Professional".
  Minor Features:
    - Added command /simple-trade-loops, which dumps to the script-output all existing two-trade loops in your game involving only two items at a time.
        Faster and more convenient than analyzing trade JSON exports yourself, but less useful since no metrics are measured.
    - When pinging an interplanetary trade in chat or creating a tag for one, the blue arrow is now used instead of the gray arrow.
  Changes:
    - Revised item rank up requirements:
        Bronze - unchanged (buy and sell item once)
        Silver - buy this item using a trade with at least +10% productivity

  Bugfixes:

        Single-hex loops of three trades or more are still possible but are very unlikely, and detection of such more heavily impacts performance.
    - Fixed a bug in random trade volume sampling, making higher valued items show up in trades closer to the center of each planet.
    - Fixed the planet listing method for the silver bonus description in the catalog so that modded surfaces don't show up.
    - Fixed locale for tesla destroyer robot tech.
    - Fixed quest condition checking for getting items to specific ranks.
    - Fixed that the hex core GUI would initially show for steel chests upon loading a save.

    - [item=firearm-magazine] and [item=piercing-rounds-magazine] are now also craftable in [entity=foundry].
    - Demolisher tech no longer requires production science like most other military techs.

    - Fewer of the more distant hexes than the ones near spawn have resources, on all planets.
  Optimizations:
    - Greatly optimized hex generation and overall UPS.
    - Further optimized hex generation ahead of time in uncharted areas (for charting at fast speeds).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.4.2
Date: 1/6/25
  Features:
    - Added many more quests and rewards.

    - Sentient Spider now has a larger equipment grid.
    - Trades can now only be made with researched qualities.

  Balancing:
    - Supercharging is now unlocked on [planet=vulcanus].
    - Quality trades now have a trade productivity decrement based on the tier of quality, e.g. an uncommon trade loses 35% productivity.
      Negative productivity will decrease the trade's output rate, e.g. -100% prod means 1/2 of normal output rate, -200% prod means 1/3 of normal output rate, etc.
      This prevents the exploit of quickly generating unlimited [item=hexaprism-coin] on Nauvis before you have to visit other planets.

    - The spawn hex on [planet=gleba] now generates with a starting amount of [entity=yumako-tree] and [entity=jellystem].

    - [planet=vulcanus], [planet=fulgora], and [planet=gleba] now have finite planet size.

    - Removed tree seeds from trade generation on [planet=nauvis].
    - Removed discharge defense equipment from trade generation on all planets except [planet=fulgora]. (IT IS BUFFED)
  Balancing:
    - Buffed [item=discharge-defense-equipment]. It now functions as a personal tesla turret like Wube Software probably would have originally intended, given that it has always been an electric beam weapon.
    - Buffed [item=destroyer-capsule]. It now functions as a flying tesla turret like Wube Software probably would have originally intended, given that it has always used an electric beam weapon.

        Normal in, normal out. Rare in, rare out, etc.
        Only one trade is needed for all qualities. Works up to the hex core's quality.
        Coins do not have quality, so they multiply for each quality tier.
        NOTE: Quality purchases require more coins than the coins obtained from selling at the same quality.
        (This is a default mod setting to prevent an infinite coin exploit.)
    - Dropdown added to hex cores for viewing trades with different qualities on the items, particularly used to see how coin inputs and outputs are affected by quality.
    - Production statistics now include the statistics of currently active trading on each surface.
    - Added selection tool for claiming hexes.

    - Clicking on the arrow in a trade pings it in chat.
    - Clicking on any ping in chat that's on a hex core brings up that hex core's GUI.
    - When viewing a hex core, clicking on an item in a trade brings up that item in the Factoriopedia.
  Features:
    - When viewing the trade overview, clicking on an item in a trade sets the filter to that item on the opposite side of the trade.
      For example, you click on an input item for a trade, it sets the trade overview filter so that you can see trades that let you obtain that item.
      Helps to quickly find trade loops.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that input loaders on the sides of hex cores weren't working.
    - Fixed that new trades that should have productivity didn't.
